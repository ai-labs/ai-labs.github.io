title:  Context-free grammars for English noun phases in brown terms.
excerpt_separator: <!--more-->
---

We designed an extremely simple np extractor. See it on [github](https://github.com/korobool/simple_np). 
```
Simple noun phrases extractor which uses context-free 
grammar appears to be more robust for cases with noise 
and grammatically broken structure 
```
There are many modern NLP tools, like spacy that are able to find noun-phrases. 
All of them work well on a consistent text that can be parsed into a correct syntax tree. 
In cases when syntax is broken, POS and tree parsers become weak and things go worse. 
This solution has a goal to use extremely simple context free grammars on top of very 
simple and in general less accurate POS tagger consuming it's only strong side - robustness 
for noised broken text. It is expected to be much weaker on a normal text, but perform 
better on input like twitter and chats.

## Context-free grammar 
Can be represented in code as a set of templates like this:


```python
np_rules = {
    ('CD', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('CD', 'NN'),
    ('CD', 'RB', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('DT', 'CD', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('DT', 'CD', 'NN'),
    ('DT', 'CD', 'RB', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('DT', 'JJ', 'CD', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('DT', 'JJ', 'CD', 'NN'),
    ('DT', 'JJ', 'CD', 'RB', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('DT', 'JJ', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('DT', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('DT', 'JJ', 'RB', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('DT', 'NN'),
    ('DT', 'RB', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('DT', 'RB', 'VB', 'NN'),
    ('DT', 'VB', 'NN'),
    ('JJ', 'CD', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('JJ', 'CD', 'NN'),
    ('JJ', 'CD', 'RB', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('JJ', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('JJ', 'NN'),
    ('JJ', 'RB', 'JJ', 'NN'),
    ('NN',)
}
``` 

## What is a Noun Phrase?
A noun phrase is a group of words that work together to name and describe a person, place, thing, or idea. 
Better to say "an entity" that behaves like a simple noun. Paraphrasing this, we can say that when 
we look at the structure of writing, we treat a noun phrase the same way we treat a common noun.

## Simple guide
[here](https://github.com/korobool/simple_np/blob/master/how-to-use.ipynb) you can see a jupyter notebook with examples 
* First, ipmort required functions
```
from np_extractor import get_nps_from_text, get_nps_from_tokens
```
* If you just want to get NP groups from a text
Just call a ```get_nps_from_text()``` giving the text as an input.
```python
text = 'What a great shame you do not look after the wildlife as well as a noun chunk.'
print(get_nps_from_text(text))
```
```bash
>>> ['a great shame', 'the wildlife', 'a noun chunk']
```
* If you want get some more advanced info on rules which caused mathces and tokens indecies
Use brown-based POS tagger (for instance NLTK) to obtain tagged tokens like this
```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk import pos_tag
pos_tag(word_tokenize(text))
```
and feed the list to ```get_nps_from_tokens()```

```python
print(get_nps_from_tokens(pos_tag(word_tokenize(text))))
```

```bash
>>> {'matches': [(1, 3), (9, 10), (14, 16)], 'rules': [('DT', 'NN'), ('DT', 'NN'), ('DT', 'JJ', 'NN')], 
'matches_text': [['a', 'great', 'shame'], ['the', 'wildlife'], ['a', 'noun', 'chunk']]}
```
